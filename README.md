Advanced IDS leveraging Novel Deep Learning for robust and scalable intrusion detection in Network


### NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING NOVEL DEEP LEARNING MODEL

# Overview
This project introduces a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) environments, utilizing an innovative approach combining Just-in-Time Scalable Kernel Width Transformation and Federated Transfer Learning Soft-Root-Sign Kernelized Long Short-Term Memory (FedTL-SRSKLSTM). The system is designed to address the challenges of detecting attacks within network blind spots by leveraging advanced clustering techniques, feature similarity evaluation, and federated learning principles to ensure comprehensive network security coverage.

# Key Features
Advanced Intrusion Detection: Utilizes JSKWT and FedTL-SRSKLSTM for high-accuracy threat detection and classification.
Cluster Head (CH) Selection: Implements Adaptive Linear Varying Honey Badger Algorithm (ALV-HBA) for optimal CH selection among sensor nodes.
Efficient Clustering: Employs Heming Wayed Fuzzy C-Means (HeWaFCM) for effective data clustering and transmission to sink nodes.
Data Preprocessing & Balancing: Integrates methods for data deduplication, numeralization, normalization, and balancing for optimal model training.
Feature Evaluation & Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes Kruskal-Wallis Test (KWT) and Cutting L1-Norm PCA (CutLNPCA) for feature evaluation and reduction.
Federated Learning Model: Leverages a FedTL approach for continuous model improvement and adaptation to new threats.
GUI Integration: Features a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction with the system.
